## Hello, I'm Daniel from [DeveloperDan.com](https://www.github.developerdan.com/)

I'm a Software Engineer with over 10 years professional experiance working at all levels of the stack. Below are a couple of my more recent open source projects. Please feel free to [have a discussion](https://github.com/lightswitch05/lightswitch05/discussions/1) with me if you have any questions, or perhaps checkout my website which has more of my historical projects and open source contributions. 

### Projects

[Blocklist Tools](https://blocklist-tools.developerdan.com/)

Search popular domain and host formatted blocklists for specific entries. The search is performed against all available versions of the lists, so not only will you discover which lists contain the entry, but also when it was added to the list (and also optionally removed). Currently, it has over 16 million unique and valid domains sourced from over 50,000 list versions containing over 5.6 billion entries.

[PHP Version Audit](https://www.github.developerdan.com/php-version-audit/)

PHP Version Audit is a convenience tool to easily check a given PHP version against a regularly updated list of CVE exploits, new releases, and end of life dates. CVE lists and PHP release information are automatically scanned twice a day (via Github Actions) to ensure any new patches are found quickly and reported. PHP Version Audit was specifcally designed with automation in mind and would fit perfect in a CI/CD pipeline.

[Node Version Audit](https://www.github.developerdan.com/node-version-audit/)

CVE lists and Node.js release information are automatically scanned twice a day (via Github Actions) to ensure any new patches are found quickly and reported.
